# AutoTasker – Smart To-Do List Manager

## Overview
AutoTasker is a no-code workflow built using WorqHat that helps users manage daily tasks.
Users can add new tasks, view their list, and mark tasks as complete — all through automated workflows.

## Features
- Add new tasks (Task Name + Due Time)
- View all pending/completed tasks
- Update task status (pending → done)
- Fully no-code solution

## Workflow Summary
1. REST API Trigger → receives user input  
2. Add Data Node → saves new tasks into the database  
3. Query Data Node → fetches all tasks  
4. Return Node → outputs a success message or task list

## Database Design
Table: **tasks**
| Column | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| task_name | short text | Name of the task |
| due_time | short text | Task due time |
| status | short text | pending / done |
| created_at | datetime | auto timestamp |
